## 1. Narrative Goal

In this sprint, we're building the heart of our application: the DOCX parser module. This critical component will transform career description documents into structured data that powers our entire application. By the end of these four days, we'll have a robust, reliable parser that can intelligently extract sections like "Career Snapshot," "Role Overview," and "Skills Needed" from Word documents, even when formatting varies. We'll implement a pipeline that converts DOCX files to HTML, walks the DOM to identify sections (including handling unmatched sections gracefully), and generates a clean JSON structure. We'll also add keyword extraction and basic tagging capabilities to make careers searchable. This sprint is about creating the "magic" that transforms unstructured documents into valuable, structured career information, laying the groundwork for more advanced semantic understanding in later stages.
